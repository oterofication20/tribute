            "We, in Africa, have no more need of being 'converted' to socialism than we have of being 'taught' democracy. Both are rooted in our past -- in the traditional society which produced us."
            Julius Kambarage Nyerere, from his book Uhuru na Umoja (Freedom and Unity): Essays on Socialism, 1967. -

            <h2>Brief Intro</h2>
            <p>
Julius Kambarage Nyerere (April 13, 1922 - October 14, 1999) was President of Tanzania 
(previously Tanganyika), from the country's founding in 1964, until his retirement in 
1985. Born in Tanganyika to a local Zanaki chief called Nyerere Burito, Julius Nyerere 
was known by the Swahili name Mwalimu, or "teacher," because of his profession before 
becoming active in politics. Nyerere was the first African head of state to retire 
voluntarily. He stepped down because he realized that his socialist policies of 
communal ownership of farms and state ownership of services were not working.</p>
